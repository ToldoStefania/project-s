    | IDEA: API Youtube V3 to get all the comments  |
    -------------------------------------------------

TO DO LIST:

- ASK the user to input the link of the youtube link
- Use regex to parse the string and get the youtube video ID from it
- Use youtube API to get all the comments from it
- Store the data into .xlsx file
- Iterate through the comments and with nltk file analyze the semantic of all the comments and add score to another column
- Use the likes number to modify the overall score
- Write algorithm to save the score and giver results to user (min max etc...)

possible idea:
make graph over time comments and consents to see if there is a specific time where people where more happy or unhappy with the video
